Manual VIM configuration

    If you haven't yet switched to a Modern VIM package manager, you can of
    course copy the code from `ftplugin/perl.vim` into your Vim configuration
    as appropriate!

    You will need to install the fatpacked file from the bin directory of
    the Perl::Tags CPAN module.  This file goes into ~/.vim/perllib/bin

    You can download the fatpacked file from the master Github branch
    from:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osfameron/perl-tags/master/bin/require-perl-tags-packed


# USAGE

    * open a Perl file
    * use Tags as normal: <C-]>, <C-t>, g]  etc.
    * :call PT_show_tags()  # view the generated tags file

# NOTE

This plugin is under development.  Comments from more experienced
Vim hackers are welcome, as are bug reports and pull requests.

The fatpacked dependencies have been generated and tested on Perl 5.14.2
(which is the default on the popular Debian Wheezy (stable) and Ubuntu
Precise64 Linux distributions.)  Does it work on other platforms?  Please
let me know!

# TODO

    * consider using a tagger per file-path?
    * allow user to use non-fatpacked Perl::Tags or other customizations
    * more documentation
    * tests
